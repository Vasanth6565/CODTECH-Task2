Task: DATA PROCESSING



Overview of the Project:
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The steps involved in this project include data inspection, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each step:

1. Data Inspection and Exploration:
The first step is to understand the dataset by inspecting its structure and summarizing its contents.

Load Data: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Initial Exploration: Display the first few rows, basic information about the dataset, and summary statistics for both numerical and categorical features.

2. Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning involves preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values, removing duplicates, handling outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

Handle Missing Values: Fill missing values for numerical columns with the median and for categorical columns with the mode.
Remove Duplicates: Ensure there are no duplicate rows in the dataset.
Handle Outliers: Clip outliers in numerical columns to a reasonable range.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
Remove Unnecessary Columns: Drop columns that are not useful for the model, such as PassengerId, Name, Ticket, and Cabin.

3. Feature Engineering:
Create new features that might help improve the model's performance.

Family Size: Create a new feature FamilySize by combining SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard) and Parch (number of parents/children aboard).

4. Data Splitting:
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Features and Target: Separate the features (X) from the target variable (y).
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

5. Model Building and Evaluation:
Train a machine learning model and evaluate its performance.

Model Training: Train a Random Forest classifier on the training data.
Model Prediction: Predict on the test set.
Model Evaluation: Calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set.

6. Model Interpretation and Validation:
Understand the model's behavior and validate its performance.

Feature Importance: Determine the importance of each feature in the model.
Cross-Validation: Perform cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.

7. Model Saving and Loading:
Save the trained model to a file and ensure it can be loaded correctly.

Save Model: Save the trained model using joblib.
Load Model: Load the saved model and verify its performance.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize the model by tuning its hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

GridSearchCV: Perform an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid.
RandomizedSearchCV: Perform a randomized search over specified parameter distributions.
Best Model: Update the model with the best parameters found during the hyperparameter tuning.

9. Model Evaluation on Test Data:
Evaluate the final model on the test data to ensure its performance.

Predict on Test Data: Use the best model to predict on the test set.
Evaluate Performance: Calculate accuracy on both training and test data and perform cross-validation with the best model.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to building a machine learning model for predicting Titanic passenger survival. It covers the entire pipeline from data inspection and cleaning to model building, tuning, and evaluation, ensuring that the final model is both accurate and robust. The steps involved ensure that the data is well-prepared, the model is well-tuned, and the results are thoroughly evaluated, providing a reliable predictive model.
